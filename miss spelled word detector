Identify misspelled words and provide suggestions for correct words.

Use fuzzy logic (https://nanonets.com/blog/fuzzy-matching-fuzzy-logic/) and some string difference algorithms like
edit distance
cos theta comparison
some other distance like length 
assign each distance some  weight and find the similarity index and then use the similarity index to find or suggest the closest words if not the correct word.
