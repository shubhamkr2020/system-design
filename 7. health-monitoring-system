Notes:

1. Time series dataset should be used, it helps in analysis as well, 
      time series db: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZPTpa3JcKA&list=PLsdq-3Z1EPT27BuTnJ_trF7BsaTpYLqst&index=43
2. Time series databases - Amazon timestream, prometheus, etc.
3. Talk about push and pull mechanisms whenever possible and select the better one with reasons.

4. Use batch processing when there are a lot of API/RPC calls on the servers.
  Collect the data and call the server only once (if possible) with the batch of the data as input.

5. When there is a lot of data to be processed at once, use stream data processing and message queue in between.
  Use a queue to store the stream of data as input and then use streaming to process the queue data efficiently.

Approaches:

1. centralised service for health check
2.
