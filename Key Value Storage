1. Functional Requirements:
  1. put(key, value)
  2. get(key)
  3. separate service to store the key value pairs.

2. Non Functional requirments:
  1. low latency
  2. high avialability
  3. highly or automatically scalable

3. Single server key value store optimisations:
  compression
  use disks to store - but even with these highly scalable system is not possible

4. Distributed key value store
