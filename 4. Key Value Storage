1. Functional Requirements:
  1. put(key, value)
  2. get(key)
  3. separate service to store the key value pairs.

2. Non Functional requirments:
  1. low latency
  2. high avialability
  3. highly or automatically scalable

3. Single server key value store optimisations:
  compression
  use disks to store - but even with these highly scalable system is not possible

4. Distributed key value store
  1. use consistent hashing to distribute the servers and hash the clients to serve the request efficiently.

5. Bloom filter:
  Algorithm to find if the data is present in the given partition (huge data) or not.
  So, bloom filter is used to find which node has the data and then query that data.
