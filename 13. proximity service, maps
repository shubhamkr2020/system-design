  1. add new business locations
  2. search for nearby locations or any locaitons
  3. view business locations for the locations
  4. update business locations and their info

2. NFRs:
  1. low latency
  2. high availability
  3. scalable

3. estimations
  500M locations
  2M DAU and 10 queries per day each user
  calculate

4. Components
  1. Users - for searching and adding locations
  2. Location service to add/update the locations
  3. lookup location service
  4. Databses to store the business location info
  5. Analytical DBs
  6. 



5. Schema of the add locations, view locations with lat-long info.

6. B-trees - inefficient in multi range query
    R- Trees - 
    Quad-Trees - most efficient.
        having four children for each node with the point x, y values. O(logn) for read and write both.
